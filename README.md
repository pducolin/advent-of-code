## This year - 2022

I will use golang, as it is the language I use the most these days.

### TIL

#### Embed

Allows to include files and directories in a binary. Paths are relative to the directory containing the Go source file.

It allows loading a file content at runtime, in one line ðŸ¤¯

Given the following file system

```txt
.
â”œâ”€â”€ go.mod
â”œâ”€â”€ go.sum
â”œâ”€â”€ template
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ input.txt
|   â””â”€â”€ template.go
â””â”€â”€ main.go
```

```go
package template

import (
  _ "embed" // if you don't use any `embed` functions you need to import it only for its sideeffect with `_` 
  "fmt"
)

//go:embed input.txt
var inputData string

func PrintEmbed() {
  fmt.Println(inputData)
}
```
